Welcome to Eunice.

You are standing in a yard just south of an old, wood house. 
At one time it was a dearly loved home, a place of comfort and laughter.
Now it stands silent and empty, with its windows boarded up. 

Rotten wooden boards, twisted metal, and old tires lie abandoned in the yard crowding the plants.
It could use a little cleaning up.

A little note is stuck on a rusty nail.

You decide its time to begin making a change.

The note reads:

Welcome to Eunice, it is a shadow of its former glory.

Use simple instructions to interact with this place and its strange inhabitants.
To move around use cardinal compass directions or 'go' + cardinal compass direction

Type 'look' to view your surroundings, and keep an eye out for possible changes.

Type 'exit' to leave the game.

Type 'investigate' + object to find out more about a specific thing.

Remember, you will get as much from the game as you decide to put in to it.

This was once a beautiful garden.
Now there is more trash on the ground than plants.
It could use a clean up.

You look closer and recognize ragged lavender plant, a tired rose bush.
A note is stuck to a rose thorn.
 
A field stretches out to the west, south, and east.
North of you is a boarded-up house.
"""
descript['clean_yard'] = """
Its a huge job, but you organize some of the broken objects into piles and 
clear some space around the plants. Beneath the trash you find a delicate 
butterfly wing. 

You keep it for later.

Tall grasses wave in the breeze. 
The air smells green and wet.

As you walk forward, on thick moss, the ground quakes slightly with each footfall.

You are walking on water - or above it - on many layers of moss that have grown over

Who knows what treasures lie below the deep moss...

A toad is nestled into the moss, as if he was sitting among many overstuffed pillows.
He looks to be asleep, and regularly makes snoring croaking sounds.

To the west is a large wooden notice board.

A large public notice board stands in the middle of the wide field. 

You wonder why the builder decided to put it out here far from any road or town.
Clearly people once came here, because there are two colorful notes pinned to the board.

You also notice extra pins, and a pad of blank paper with a pencil on a thin green ribbon 
next to the board.

The notes are all about gratitude!

descript['front_door'] = """
The porch is slanting away from the house, it's likely some of the floor boards are rotten.

Thick dust covers everything. You cough as your eyes slowly accustom to the dim room.

A table with a broken leg and knocked over chair were abandoned in the western corner. 
You can hear scrabbling of some small animals in the walls.

In the south corner is a large, dirty steamer trunk. Sitting on the trunk is a huge troll.
His face is drawn into a menacing grimace.

A polished oak table and chair with a blue cushion fits into the west corner.

brown, and its brass fittings sparkle in the sunlight.

The wing glitters in deep browns with facinful swirls of gold and blue.

curiosity['toad'] = """
The toad is large and green and frowning. His eyes are closed and makes loud croaking noises every so often.

As you look closer, you notice a curved lillypad, about the size of a plate, near the frog.
'Advice given in exchange for snacks' is printed on the plate.

The frog does look a little out of sorts, maybe he is hungry.
