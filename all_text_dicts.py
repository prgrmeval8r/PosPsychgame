descript['front_yard'] = """
A few desperate weeds struggle in the dusty ground. You look closer and recognize 
ragged lavender plant, a tired rose bush, and realize that this was once a beautiful garden. 
Now there is more trash here than plants. 
"""
descript['notice_board'] = """
A large public notice board stands in the middle of the wide field. You wonder why the builder 
decided to put it out here far from any road or town.
Clearly a few people once came here, because there are a few colorful pages pinned to the board.
You also notice extra pins, and a pad of blank paper with a pencil on a thin green ribbon 
next to the board.
"""
descript['front_door'] = """
The porch is slanting away from the house, it's likely some of the floor boards are rotten.
You step carefully and notice there is an old mailbox next to a very large front door. 
The windows are boarded up. You cannot see in.
"""
descript['south_field'] = """
The field stretches out before you.
"""
descript['inside_house'] = """
Thick dust covers everything. You cough as your eyes slowly accustom to the dim room.

A table with a broken leg and knocked over chair were abandoned in the western corner. 
A sink and cabinet sits along the north - east wall, and you can hear scrabbling of 
some small animals.
In the south corner is a large, dirty steamer trunk. Sitting on the trunk is a huge troll.
"""
descript['front_yard2'] = """
Green flowering herbs and bushes wave in the slight breeze. You can smell the light fragrance
of many flowers and hear the industrious buzzing of bees around you.
Many more notes have been added to yours on the public gratitude board!
"""
descript['front_door2'] = """
The front door is painted deep green with little carvings of ivy and berries in the corner.
"""

descript['inside_house2'] = """
You look around an notice that the boards have disappeared from the window and you are
now in a tiny home.

A polished oak table and chair with a blue cushion fits into the west corner. 
There is a bowl of fruit by  sink and cabinets are bright yellow. 

And in the south corner the steamer trunk has been polished. Its leather gleams a rich dark
brown, and its brass fittings sparkle in the sunlight.
