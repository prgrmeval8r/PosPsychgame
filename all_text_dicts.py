Welcome to Eunice.

You are standing in a yard just south of an old, wooden house.

Now it stands silent and empty, with it's windows boarded up.

Type 'look' to view your surroundings, and keep an eye out for changes.

Type 'exit' to leave the game.

Type 'investigate' + object to find out more about a specific thing.

Remember, you will get as much from the game as you decide to put in to it.
