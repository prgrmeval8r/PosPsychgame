A few desperate weeds struggle in the dusty ground. 
You look closer and recognize ragged lavender plant, a tired rose bush.
This was once a beautiful garden. 
Now there is more trash here than plants. 
"""
descript['west_field'] = """
The west field is a barren dusty place. 
The land quickly becomes hilly.
In the far distance you can see the hills grow into jagged mountains that overwhelm the 
horizon.
Closer to you is a large wooden notice board.
"""
descript['notice_board'] = """
A large public notice board stands in the middle of the wide field. 
You wonder why the builder decided to put it out here far from any road or town.
Clearly people once came here, because there are a few colorful notes pinned to the board.
You also notice extra pins, and a pad of blank paper with a pencil on a thin green ribbon 
next to the board.
The notes are all about gratitude!
"""
descript['front_door'] = """
The porch is slanting away from the house, it's likely some of the floor boards are rotten.
You step carefully and notice there is an old mailbox and dirty welcome mat next to a 
very large front door. 
The windows of the house are boarded up. 
You cannot see in.
"""

The field stretches out before you.
"""
descript['inside_house'] = """
Thick dust covers everything. You cough as your eyes slowly accustom to the dim room.

A table with a broken leg and knocked over chair were abandoned in the western corner. 
A dirty sink and cabinet sits along the north - east side.
You can hear scrabbling of some small animals in the walls.
In the south corner is a large, dirty steamer trunk. Sitting on the trunk is a huge troll.
"""
descript['front_yard2'] = """
Green flowering herbs and bushes wave in the slight breeze. 
You can smell the light fragrance of many flowers and hear the industrious buzzing of bees around you.
"""
descript['front_door2'] = """
The porch looks recently painted and repaired. 
There is the same old mailbox and dirty welcome mat next to a very large front door. 
The windows of the house are boarded up. 
You cannot see in.
"""
descript['inside_house2'] = """
You look around an notice that the boards have disappeared from the window and you are
now in a tiny home.

A polished oak table and chair with a blue cushion fits into the west corner. 
There is a bowl of fruit by  sink and cabinets are bright yellow. 

And in the south corner the steamer trunk has been polished. Its leather gleams a rich dark
brown, and its brass fittings sparkle in the sunlight.

You open the mailbox and peer inside. 
There is a sudden rustling and a pair of beady eyes glare at you from a tiny wrinkled face.

He screeches loudly: 'BAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!'

The elf takes the paper bird, almost as large as he is, and places it carefully in a
 corner of the mailbox.
A ghost of a smile glides across his face, 'Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh me,

The elf says, 'That is very generous of you. 
Its been so long since I met an actual human.
Tell me about youself.'
